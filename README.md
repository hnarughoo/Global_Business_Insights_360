# 📊 Atliq Hardware Analytics Project

## 📁 Overview

**Atliq Hardware** is one of the fastest-growing companies in the global electronics market. It sells computer hardware products such as PCs, printers, and accessories through various channels—including **Retailers**, **Distributors**, and **Direct Sales**. These products reach end-consumers via both **E-Commerce platforms** and **Brick & Mortar stores**.

As Atliq’s operations have expanded globally, the complexity of their business has increased significantly. To stay competitive and agile in this dynamic market, they need to transition from traditional decision-making approaches to data-driven strategies.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Despite impressive growth, Atliq faced a major setback during their expansion into the **Latin American** market. After opening a company-owned retail store, they suffered substantial losses—primarily because decisions were based on intuition and limited survey data.

Traditionally, Atliq relied heavily on Excel for storing and analyzing data. However, as the business grew, Excel became inefficient and unsuitable for handling the volume and complexity of their operations.

Meanwhile, their key competitor, **Dell**, has invested heavily in data analytics—conducting detailed analyses on customer demographics, income levels, and purchasing behavior. To remain competitive, Atliq must do the same by embedding analytics at the core of its strategic decision-making.

As a result, the company decided to establish a **Data Analytics Team** with a clear mandate:
- Transition from spreadsheet-based analysis to a modern, scalable analytics ecosystem.
- Improve data visibility and transparency across the organization.
- Enable data-informed decisions at all levels of the business.
